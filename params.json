{"name":"Ffnpdf","body":"# FFNPDF\r\n\r\nJust scratched an coding itch I've had for quite some time.\r\n\r\nThis gem scrapes stories from FanFiction.net and generates LaTeX PDFs. Polished turds, anyone?\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nRuby hackers already know how to install this stupid gem. But for everyone else, here's how to install it in Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nFirst install [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org). I'm guessing the gem won't work with ruby 1.8 so you'll need to install ruby 1.9:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1 ruby1.9.1-dev build-essential libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev\r\n    \r\nThen install the gem via `gem install`:\r\n\r\n    sudo gem install ffnpdf\r\n\r\nIt also requires [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) as well as a bunch of extra stuff related to LaTeX/XeTeX. In Ubuntu, you can install this using the following command:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install pandoc texlive-latex-extra texlive-xetex\r\n\r\nIt also uses [DejaVu Fonts](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) as the default font. This font family is installed by default in Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe basic command only requires the story's story ID.\r\n\r\n    ffnpdf [STORY_ID]\r\n\r\nThis will scrape FFN for the story, convert the chapters into markdown, combine all chapters into a single file, and converts it into PDF, all inside the `STORY_ID` folder.\r\n\r\n## Additional Commands\r\n\r\nSince you may want to do your own edits to the fics (e.g. remove authors notes, correct chapter headers) there are additional commands that allow you to perform individual steps of the process.\r\n\r\n### Pull\r\n\r\n    ffnpdf pull [STORY_ID]\r\n\r\nThis command \r\n\r\n* creates the `STORY_ID` folder\r\n* pulls chapters and converts them to Markdown\r\n* creates template and variables (config) file\r\n\r\nThe markdown files are numbered from `0001.md` onwards. A title section, `0000.md`, is also created.\r\n\r\nThe `xetex.template` file is obviously the XeTeX template, while the `variables.txt` defines the [template variables section](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#general-writer-options) used when generating the PDF. Both can be modified to affect the result of running both `ffnpdf build` and `ffnpdf convert`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n    ffnpdf build [STORY_ID]\r\n\r\nThis command \r\n\r\n* combines all `.md` files to a single file, `combined.md`, in alphabetical order\r\n* converts `combined.md` to `combined.pdf` while using both the template and variables file\r\n\r\n### Convert\r\n\r\n    ffnpdf convert [STORY_ID]\r\n\r\nThis command does only the second step of the Build i.e. converts `combined.md` to `combined.pdf`.\r\n\r\n## How-To Videos\r\n\r\nI've made a YouTube playlist with demos and how-tos [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA7C6F157E1651A69).\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n**Page numbering in bookmark is incorrect for stories with long Table of Contents**\r\n\r\nIt's a tradeoff between wrong numbering in the Table of Contents or in the bookmarks. I chose the latter.\r\n\r\nI still don't know the root cause, though.\r\n","tagline":"converts fanfiction.net stories into classy LaTeX pdf","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
